## Week 1  

Finish up the Work Plan; Load, normalise and view SEG-Y data on jupyter notebook; Set up the code architecture of the mission and design some neural networks. Use two of the neural networks to predict the porosity and shale/sandstone portion from Excel data and record the loss.

## Week 2  

Have done the first model; Implement many data loading and augmentation methods; Get models for exercises as well.


## Week 3  

Have done the set-up for both Feed forward and Convolutional Neural Networks training; Get a lot different of methods to test the model performance


## Week 3  

Tried different complex networks but doesn't work because the CPU issue; Test the models on test slice. Done the set-up for the variogram calculation.
