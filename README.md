## Week 1  

Finish up the Work Plan; Load, normalise and view SEG-Y data on jupyter notebook; Set up the code architecture of the mission and design some neural networks. Use two of the neural networks to predict the porosity and shale/sandstone portion from Excel data and record the loss.

## Week 2  

Have done the first model; Implement many data loading and augmentation methods; Get models for exercises as well.


## Week 3  

Have done the set-up for both Feed forward and Convolutional Neural Networks training; Get a lot different of methods to test the model performance


## Week 4  

Tried different complex networks but doesn't work because the CPU issue; Test the models on test slice; Done the set-up for the variogram calculation.


## Week 5  

Trained with complex networks and different parameters for CNN; Done a work version of U-Net model; Done GAN and DCGAN set up.


## Week 6 & 7

Trained with other attributes to achieve a 3D training. Created a full version Jupyter Notebook with all models. Separated the train file with the helper functions.
